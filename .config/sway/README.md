### Files convention:
As I'm developing my configs with `VSCode` editor I've configured it with `i3` extension which is not fully covers `sway` config syntax but it's easier to with with it than without.

Workspace settings at `.vscode/settings.json` have file association setup for `*.sway.conf` extension to automatically set language mode as `i3`. This is the reason of naming files like `[filename].sway.conf`
